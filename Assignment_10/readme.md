## ðŸ”§ Implementation Language and Design Decisions

This project is implemented in **JavaScript (ES6)** because it is widely used for both front-end and back-end development, and allows for flexible, object-oriented code using classes and modules.

### Key Design Decisions:
- Classes are organized under the `/src/models` directory.
- Each class file corresponds to the structure from the UML class diagram.
- ES6 syntax is used for modern best practices (`import/export`, class constructors, arrow functions).
- Inheritance is demonstrated in the `Admin` class which extends `User`.
- Future files will include creational design pattern examples and unit tests.

This setup prepares the app for applying creational patterns and clean testing using tools like **Jest** or **Mocha**.
