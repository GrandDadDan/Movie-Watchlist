# Reflection

Choosing and customizing a GitHub project template came with more challenges than I expected. At first, I thought it would be as simple as picking a layout and getting started, but I quickly realized that each template serves a very specific purpose—and not all of them fit my workflow. For example, the basic Kanban and bug tracker templates looked straightforward, but they didn’t support the kind of structured sprint planning I wanted. I had to spend some time exploring the Iterative Development template before realizing it was the best fit for my Agile-style workflow.

Customizing the board was another learning curve. GitHub lets you edit columns and add automation, but it’s not as visually intuitive as some other tools like Trello. I had to think carefully about which columns made sense for my app. I added “Testing” and “Blocked” to make the board more useful for tracking quality checks and task delays. It took a few tries to get the columns in the right order and make sure each task flowed naturally from one stage to the next.

Compared to tools like Trello or Jira, GitHub’s project templates are simpler but a bit more manual. Trello is very drag-and-drop and beginner-friendly, while Jira offers powerful features like built-in reporting and backlog grooming—but it can also feel overwhelming and too complex for solo projects. GitHub strikes a good balance. It’s tightly integrated with issues, pull requests, and repositories, which makes it really efficient for developers like me who are already using GitHub for code. Once I figured out how to link issues and move them through my custom columns, it felt much more natural and organized.

Overall, while the setup wasn’t completely seamless, the process helped me understand Agile planning and workflow design better. I also appreciate that GitHub Projects gives me more control than Trello but isn’t as heavy as Jira. It’s a great option for someone like me who’s building a solo project but still wants to apply proper development practices.
