## 🛠️ Kanban Board Customization

To better support Agile development and testing workflows, the following customizations were made to the GitHub Project board:

- **Added a ‘Testing’ column** to align with future Quality Assurance needs. As features are completed by developers, they are moved to this column for verification.
- **Added a ‘Blocked’ column** to identify tasks that are paused due to unresolved issues or external dependencies. This helps highlight bottlenecks and improves transparency during stand-ups and retrospectives.

All tasks from the sprint backlog were created as GitHub Issues and linked to this board. Issues are labeled (`feature`, `bug`, etc.) and assigned appropriately using `@mentions`. Task statuses are updated in real-time to reflect current progress.
