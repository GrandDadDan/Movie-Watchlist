## 2️⃣ Justification for Chosen Template: Iterative Development

The Iterative Development template is the most suitable for my Movie Watchlist App because it closely aligns with the Agile methodology I’m following. I’m working in 2-week sprints and already have a structured product backlog with clearly defined user stories, acceptance criteria, and effort estimates. This template allows me to:

Organize my tasks based on current and future iterations.

Clearly separate tasks that are In Progress, In Review, or Done.

Track sprint goals and focus on delivering the Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

Unlike basic Kanban or feature-focused templates, Iterative Development supports cyclical planning and backlog grooming, which is exactly how I’m managing my project workflow. It provides enough flexibility to pivot priorities while still maintaining a structured Agile approach.
