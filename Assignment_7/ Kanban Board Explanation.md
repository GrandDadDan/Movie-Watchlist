# Kanban Board Explanation

A Kanban board is a visual system that helps me track the flow of work through different stages of development. For my Movie Watchlist App, I created a custom board on GitHub with the following columns: Backlog, Ready, In Progress, In Review, Testing, Blocked, and Done. Each column reflects a specific phase in the task lifecycle, and seeing tasks move from left to right gives me a clear picture of progress and priorities.

This setup visualizes my workflow by showing exactly where each task stands. “Backlog” holds ideas or upcoming tasks, “Ready” is for items prepped for the sprint, and “In Progress” captures what I’m actively working on. Once I’ve finished coding, tasks move to “In Review” for self-review or testing, then to “Testing” for functionality checks, and finally “Done” once it’s complete. If anything gets held up—like a missing API response or a bug—it goes to “Blocked” until I can fix or unblock it.

To limit work-in-progress (WIP) and avoid getting overwhelmed, I only allow a few tasks in “In Progress” and “In Review” at once. When I see too many cards stacking up, I know it’s time to stop starting and start finishing. This helps me focus, reduce context switching, and make consistent progress. It’s especially important since I’m managing this project solo and juggling it alongside other responsibilities.

My board also strongly supports Agile principles. By breaking the project down into small, manageable stories and moving them through the pipeline, I’m working in short cycles that deliver real progress. The flexibility of the board allows me to reprioritize tasks in “Backlog” or move urgent ones to “Ready” without disrupting everything. I can even use “Blocked” as a signal to adapt my sprint and avoid wasting time on stuck tasks.
